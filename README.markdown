This is a horrid mess of some erally awesome frameworks.  Don't expect magic
from this, but if you're interested in cobbling together something this weird,
feel free:

* [CodeKickoff.com][1] - Awesome way to meld together a bunch of disparate frameworks
into one really awesome one
* [Compass][http://www.compass-style.org] - Melding of SASS and Blueprint
  basically
* [Sass][http://www.sass-lang.org] - Awesome stylesheet management, allowing
  reuse of styles and mixins and glorious things
* [IconFinder][http:www.iconfinder.com] - I'm incapable of making beautiful
  things in pictures.  These guys are great
* [Diagonia Icon Set][2] - I just like them, so if I'm not using them now,
  I will be.

There's also a [ Rakefile ][4] that I borrowed from [SeanTAllen][3].  Neat stuff,
simple, but worth it.  Kudos.
